# Project-2

*PROJECT TOPIC*
The goal for this project was to determine if the political landscape of twitter can be analysed for marketing insights. Assuming the role of marketing analysts for either a campaign office or politically leaning business, we wanted to see if we could gain useful insights from twitter, such as:

- General political sentiment/leanings of USA users
- Timing and sentiment of activity
- Messaging to captilize on/avoid

To do this, we reviewed twitter data from the few weeks prior and up to the 2020 Presidential elections. The two presidential candidates Biden and Trump served as our main focus. Each tweet reviewed was from a user in a USA location and contained hashtags related to each candidate's name. 

General findings from sentiment analyis showed a trend of more positive sentiment toward Biden than Trump. While Trump did have higher quantity of related tweets, that increased activity was seen primarily in the negative sentiment category.
